# Farnaz

Farnaz is a mobile-first, Persian/English private communication web app. The current implementation is a lightweight browser application built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Supabase.

## Current capabilities

- Email/password authentication and user profiles
- Private one-to-one conversations
- Message attachments and voice-message recording
- Saved contacts and account lookup by email or normalized phone number
- Conversation preferences and message actions
- Groups and channels, including membership and management flows
- Read-receipt and per-user message visibility features
- Persian (RTL) and English (LTR) interface modes

**Known limitations:** Audio/video call controls are currently placeholders; real-time calling is not implemented. Background push notifications and a service-worker-based offline/PWA experience are also not implemented yet. Do not treat these as production-ready features.

## Repository layout

- `index.html` — application shell and page markup
- `styles.css` — shared application styling
- `js/core.js` — Supabase setup, authentication, navigation, profiles, contacts, and shared state
- `js/chat-menu-v5.js` — private messaging, message actions, attachment/voice flows, and connection recovery
- `js/spaces.js` — groups/channels UI and related messaging flows
- `supabase/migrations/` — SQL migrations applied to the connected Supabase project and checked into source control
- `.github/workflows/validate.yml` — JavaScript syntax validation on pushes and pull requests

The application currently uses classic browser scripts and shared global state. Avoid renaming global functions or moving code between files without checking all callers and page-navigation hooks.

## Deployment

The repository is designed to be served as a static site (for example, GitHub Pages).

1. Confirm the Supabase project URL and **publishable** key in `js/core.js`.
2. Never place a Supabase `service_role` key or any secret credential in browser code.
3. Confirm that the SQL migrations in `supabase/migrations/` match the database state.
4. Publish the repository using the configured static-site deployment.
5. Open the deployed site on both desktop and an iPhone-sized viewport and run the smoke-test checklist below.

Supabase publishable keys are expected to be public in browser applications. Security must be enforced through authentication, Row Level Security (RLS), storage policies, and carefully validated database functions—not by hiding a publishable key.

## Local validation

A recent Node.js release can check JavaScript syntax without installing application dependencies:

```sh
node --check js/core.js
node --check js/chat-menu-v5.js
node --check js/spaces.js
```

These checks detect syntax errors only; they do **not** prove that browser behavior, Supabase permissions, realtime delivery, uploads, or iOS keyboard behavior work correctly. The repository's GitHub Actions workflow runs the syntax checks automatically.

## Release smoke-test checklist

Run these checks after UI, database, authentication, or message-flow changes:

1. Sign up with a new test account, sign out, and sign back in.
2. Save a contact, reload the app, and confirm it remains saved.
3. Find a test account by email and by phone (with and without a country-code prefix).
4. Send, receive, reply to, edit, and delete test messages using the available actions.
5. Confirm message selection and the delete-scope choice behave as expected.
6. Send a permitted attachment and a voice message; verify access from the intended account only.
7. Open a group and a channel; test membership, role permissions, message delivery, and message hiding.
8. Confirm users cannot read or modify another user's private messages, contacts, or profile fields.
9. Switch Persian/English and light/dark themes; check layout direction, composer placement, and the iOS keyboard.
10. Disconnect and reconnect the network; confirm the app recovers without duplicate messages.
11. Check browser console and network requests for errors.

Use dedicated test accounts and non-sensitive test content. Do not test privacy boundaries with real users' private data.

## Security and operational notes

- RLS and storage policies are part of the application boundary; review them whenever a query or table changes.
- Functions declared `SECURITY DEFINER` require particular care. Confirm their execute grants, fixed `search_path`, authentication checks, and row-level authorization before changing their privileges.
- Keep the checked-in migration history aligned with the connected database.
- Review Supabase security and performance advisors after database changes. Advisor warnings need context: a function required by an authenticated RPC flow is not automatically unsafe, and an unused index may simply not have been exercised yet.
- Enable leaked-password protection in Supabase Auth settings before inviting real users.
